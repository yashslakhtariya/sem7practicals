In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.\n","\n","**Approach**: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.\n","\n","**Results**: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner’s characteristics and payment history.\n","\n","Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset\n","\n","Try different classification models and justify which one is best using any accuracy measures.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3qR61RaOpOcO"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JjFP_6wr0rTZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724225229634,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1435,"user":{"displayName":"YASH LAKHTARIYA","userId":"11591016323986874062"}},"outputId":"a4d7aac3-5f98-48f2-d4ed-414022b2c997"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["   ID  LIMIT_BAL  SEX  EDUCATION  MARRIAGE  AGE  PAY_0  PAY_2  PAY_3  PAY_4  \\\n","0   1    20000.0    2          2         1   24      2      2     -1     -1   \n","1   2   120000.0    2          2         2   26     -1      2      0      0   \n","2   3    90000.0    2          2         2   34      0      0      0      0   \n","3   4    50000.0    2          2         1   37      0      0      0      0   \n","4   5    50000.0    1          2         1   57     -1      0     -1      0   \n","\n","   ...
